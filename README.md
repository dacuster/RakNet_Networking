This is an re-writted version of the wrapper for the native library of the RakNet network engine.

# How to use it
In order to use The raknet network engine in your project, I recommend that you study the test client and server.
See SampleClient.cs and SampleServer.cs

# What's new?
- Updated and optimized native (C++) code
- Added: Bitstream ( ***Write/read data with a simple and reliable tool, supports compression, delta compression*** )
- Added: Password for the server ( ***Restrict connections to the server with a password*** )
- Added: Data encryption ( ***Strong data encryption, you don't need to worry about connection security... You can disable it if you decide to use your own encryption*** )
- Added: Setting bandwidth limit ( ***Bandwidth limit for each connection***)
- Added: Getting specific statistics data ( ***Getting the amount of data sent/received, transfer rate, ping, loss, etc.*** )
- Added: Query Features ( ***Request server data using the UDP protocol used in any programming languages that support it*** )
- Added: Anti-DDos ( ***Restriction of connection from same address for some time*** )

# Writing own Client/Server
>You can use and modify the base scripts for yourself by adding your own logic, but I strongly recommend inheriting from the base classes (BaseClient, BaseServer, BitStream) and overriding the virtual methods in your classes. Examples of inheritance and redefinition can be [found here](https://github.com/ep1s0de3/RakNet_Networking_2/blob/main/Assets/SampleClient.cs) and [here](https://github.com/ep1s0de3/RakNet_Networking_2/blob/main/Assets/SampleServer.cs)

# Query
## Quering data from server
>To request information about the server, just send a UDP packet with the header 'RakNetQuery' to server

>See [Query Sample](https://github.com/ep1s0de3/RakNet_Networking_2/blob/main/Assets/RakQuerySample.cs)

>If the server-side response data is not specified, the server responded with the text message "RakNet Query Response is empty"

>If the server does not respond to requests, then the server is turned off, or the port on which it is running is closed, or the acceptance of requests is disabled by the user

## Set Query Responce on server-side
> To specify the data for the response call BaseServer.SetQueryResponce(byte[] data) (***It is recommended to call at intervals of 2-3 seconds***)

> To disable query processing, call BaseServer.AllowQuery(false);

# Attention!
### This version of the network engine is not compatible with others!
### After each update release, I strongly recommend replacing the libraries from the Plugins folder and all scripts to avoid connection errors and crashes.
